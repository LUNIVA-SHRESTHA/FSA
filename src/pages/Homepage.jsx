            At Future Stars, we believe that festivals are a reflection of our rich cultural
            heritage and an opportunity to instill values of unity, respect, and joy among students. 
            Throughout the year, our school celebrates a variety of festivals such as Dashain, Tihar, Holi, 
            Christmas, and many more, bringing together students from different backgrounds in a spirit 
            of harmony. These celebrations include cultural programs, art and craft activities, music, dance, 
            and sharing of traditional foods. By observing festivals together, we teach our students to 
            appreciate diversity, strengthen social bonds, and create cherished memories that enrich their 
            learning experience.
